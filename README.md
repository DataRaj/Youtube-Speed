## ⚡ What's Cool About This?
Ever get annoyed clicking through YouTube's speed menu? Me too! That's why I made this:

- Quick keys to control video speed ([ and ])
- Speed settings stick around between videos
- Clean speed display right in the player
- Super lightweight - won't slow you down
- Works right out of the box

## 🎯 How to Get Started

1. First, grab a userscript manager if you don't have one:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended)
   - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

2. Install the script:

3. Head to YouTube and try it out!

## 🎹 Controls

It's super simple:
```txt
]  ->  Speed up
[  ->  Slow down
p  ->  Back to normal (1x)
```

You'll see the current speed displayed in the video player. Easy peasy!

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Will this break my YouTube?**  
Nope! It just adds speed controls. Everything else stays the same.

**Q: Does it work on all browsers?**  
Yep, anywhere userscripts run (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

**Q: Why not use YouTube's built-in speed control?**  
Because clicking through menus is so 2010! Keyboard shortcuts are way faster.
